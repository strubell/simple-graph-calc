To compile:
-----------
IMPORTANT: You must manually specify the location of your javacup-runtime classes. On my
machine, these are located at '/usr/share/javacup/lib/javacup-runtime.jar', but they may be
somewhere different on your machine. Before attempting to compile this code, please
make sure that the JAVACUP path variable is correctly set in the Makefile. The JAVACUP variable
definition is found at the very beginning of the file.  

After you have done the above, simply type 'make' at the command line. To remove all files
generated by compilation, type 'make clean'.

To run:
-----------
After running 'make', simply execute './GraphCalc' at the command line to run the program.
Use as specified in the homework assignment.
